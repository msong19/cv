<h1>Stock Market Price API</h1>
<p>This was one of my first app projects. Ever since I was in eighth grade, I have traded stocks. Although I probably didn't do as much research
as I should have, I loved the days when my daily change shined green. Now, I place occasional trades in my free time. I created
this app because I wanted something simpler than Yahoo Finance and Robinhood: a bare bones display that offered a few points of data.
