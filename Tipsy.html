    <h1>The Bill Splitter</h1>
    <p>This bill splitter app also solved a practical problem of mine. One of my fierce passions is saving money, and after my college friends
        and I ate out a few times, I realized I could make a few dollars here and there if I paid for the meal with my card and my friends sent
        me money via Venmo. With the ease of modern day technology, my friends and I knocked two birds with one stone: I profit a few dollars each
        meal, and my friends were saved the hassle of having to carry around cash or card every time we ate out.</p>
